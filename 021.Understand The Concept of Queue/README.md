# Queue

Queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. It is similar to a line of people waiting for a bus. The first person to get in the line is the first person to get out of the line.

Queues are used to implement functions such as **breadth-first search** and **caching** in web browsers. They are also used in programming language processors for **expression evaluation** and **syntax parsing**.

## Operations

Queues support the following operations:

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of a queue
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of a queue
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the queue is full
- **Peek**: Get the value of the front element without removing it
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue
