# Stack

Stack is a data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle. It means that the last element that is added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

Stacks are used to implement functions such as **undo** and **redo** in text editors and web browsers. They are also used in programming language processors for **expression evaluation** and **syntax parsing**.

## Operations

Stacks support the following operations:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of a stack
- **Pop**: Remove an element from the top of a stack
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty
- **IsFull**: Check if the stack is full
- **Peek**: Get the value of the top element without removing it
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the stack
- **Clear**: Remove all elements from the stack
